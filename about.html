                <h3>What is the purpose of this site?</h3>
                <p>As stated on the main page, this site hosts modified IPA files (that means iOS apps) with the purpose of bypassing Mobile Device Management (MDM for short) restrictions.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Why would I want to use this site?</h3>
                <p>In case a certain app you want to use (e. g. a game or social media) is restricted by MDM, you can obtain a modified version from here, which won't be picked up.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What do I do with these files?</h3>
                <p>They're IPAs. You can install them on your iDevice with an external sideloading service, such as <a href="https://altstore.io">AltStore</a> or <a href="https://usescarlet.com">Scarlet</a> </p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Why are the app details different? Who is neoname and why are they part of every bundle ID?</h3>
                <p>Restrictions are based on bundle IDs, app categories and Springboard names. These are the 3 values that are modified on these IPAs. I write my own username (neoname, that's me!) on each IPA because it's easier to differentiate from an unmodified one and to indicate that I was the one who modified it.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Where do you take these apps from? Doesn't it count as software piracy? You can go to jail for this!</h3>
                <p>(most of) These apps are not ripped and cracked by me. They're taken from different sources throughout the World Wide Web. I only compile and modify the files. Also, it's common sense that you shouldn't download any apps you don't own, but who am I to stop you? Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯<br> So technically, it's not piracy. Practically, do whatever...</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Why does the DMCA link take me to a google search of gmail? Is this some kind of joke?</h3>
                <p>Yes, actually. It's an inside joke between me and my friends. In case of any actual legal woes, I will immediately comply with any requests from the copyright owners regarding this site.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>When are more apps going to be added to the site?</h3>
                <p>Whenever I feel like it. No, really. It's a complicated process and I don't always have the time and motivation to do it. If you have any requests, contact me by <a target="parent" href="mailto:razvanone2016@gmail.com">email</a> or talk to me in real life (if you know me, of course)</p>
